# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions 🎄

Ho Ho Ho! Welcome to my coding wonderland where I tackle the enchanting challenges of [Advent of
Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). 🌟 Each day (I wish it was each day), as we approach
Christmas, I unwrap a new coding puzzle and jingle my way through the solutions.

## How to Join the Festivities

0001. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/turtleflyer/advent-of-code-2023.git
cd advent-of-code-2023
```

0002. **Install Node.js Dependencies:**

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, and then run:

```bash
npm ci
```

0003. **Discover the Magic:**

To reveal the answers to the challenges, simply run:

```bash
npm start -- -- (--day|-d) N_OF_DAY [(--part|-p) N_OF_PART]
```

Replace `N_OF_DAY` with the day's challenge number, the same goes for the part number.

0004. **Spread the Joy:**

Feel free to explore, learn, and share the festive spirit by adding your solutions or
improvements. Contributions are like little ornaments that make this repository shine even brighter!

## Merry Coding!
